# Feeling a bit bored is it -_-

Here are a collection of games that I think will keep you occupied a bit :) or at least keep you less bored. These are some of the retro games that I usually make when I learn a new game, except that I didn't make them this time due to shortage of time. Next year I'll make sure they are original and from me :disappointed:

Click only one per day okay. There aren't many here. Look forward to more next year :)
