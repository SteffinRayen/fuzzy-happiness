# Happy Birthday Hubby :)
I am not sure as to how you will react to this, but I have put a lot of thought into this, and I hope you like it :) So here goes nothing.

It has been a little over a year being together, and your second birthday with me :wink:. Remember what I gave you last time for your birthday? I wish I can buy some food and send it to you... *sigh

So similar to last time I have come up with a few illustrations all coded from inspiration from elsewhere (dribbble shots, codepen, stackoverflow...). I really hope you like it :) You have no idea how many nights I had to stay up to finish this with all the office work and all +_+ =_= +_+

The general idea of this repo is to contain a few sorted html pages which you can open when you feel
- [Blue](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/openWhen/blue)
- [Bored](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/openWhen/bored)
- [Demotivated](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/openWhen/demotivated)
- [Homesick](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/openWhen/homesick)
- [Stressed](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/openWhen/stressed)

But before that let me [wish](https://steffinrayen.github.io/fuzzy-happiness/2018-treat/wish/cake.html) you in a Dev way
